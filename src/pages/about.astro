  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">Hi, I’m Chudi Nnorukam. I build AI-powered MVPs and SEO systems for independent creators and solo founders. I work asynchronously to deliver calm, repeatable systems that help you rank for mid-tail keywords and launch products without meetings.</p>
  <p class="text-gray-700">My mission is to empower indie creators with lean, productized services that unlock growth. With a background in AI and content strategy, I’ve helped clients achieve faster load times, increased organic traffic, and more demo requests. Let’s build something great together.</p>
